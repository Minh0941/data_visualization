Data Visualizations for learning outcomes

Here are the before(top) and after for the optimized learning outcomes. Even though the bottom has more chords notice that all the learning outcomes prereqs comes from the first four courses. This would allow a student to take those course during the same semesters. The current curriculum on the top shows that you can not take course 8 until you have completed course 7 due to LO EE06 is needed before EE07. By moving the outcomes around the student can complete the courses in less semesters and helping students graduate in 4 years rather than 5 or 6. The 4 year graduation rate directly impacts federal funding and college ranking.

The chord diagram requires a csv and json file. The AdjMat function needs to produce a json file of the matrix and a csv file that contains the course and the learning outcome

The edge bundling works off just one json file. A function needs to be created to read in the csv and produce a json that matches the sample json included.
